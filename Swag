If you want, I can now visually stack this in three vertical “audience columns” so you can hand prospects, early clients, and mature clients their own tailored view of what’s relevant — while still using the same data backbone. That way it doubles as a sales and retention tool.

Do you want me to build that audience‐specific visual layout next?
