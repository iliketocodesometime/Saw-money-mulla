‚öôÔ∏è Equity Compensation MVP ‚Äì Comprehensive Narrative Structure

‚∏ª

1. Executive Summary & Strategic Framing

What‚Äôs Included:
	‚Ä¢	This is not a general SBC industry survey.
	‚Ä¢	It‚Äôs a company-specific, insight-driven diagnostic.
	‚Ä¢	Goal: Help companies understand the impact of their equity program, not just how it works.

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Avoids generic benchmarks; delivers tailored, relevant takeaways to execs.
	‚Ä¢	Establishes the product‚Äôs value as a decision-support tool (not just a data dump).

Potential Gap:
	‚Ä¢	Could benefit from a short dashboard slide (e.g., ‚ÄúState of Your Equity Program‚Äù) to summarize the key KPIs upfront.

‚∏ª

2. Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) Plan Design

2.1. Equity Vehicle Mix

What:
	‚Ä¢	Breakdown of equity pool: RSUs, PSUs, Options, ESPP
	‚Ä¢	Comparison against peer or sector mix

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Reveals if plan is too reliant on one type of equity
	‚Ä¢	Helps leadership evaluate if a more diversified offering would boost perception/retention

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	No analysis on how equity type differs by job level (e.g., engineers vs. sales vs. G&A)

2.2. RSU Design (New Hire Focus)

What:
	‚Ä¢	Vesting structure: duration (3/4/5 yrs), cliff (e.g., 1 year), cadence (quarterly/yearly)
	‚Ä¢	Benchmark against peers

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Shows how ‚Äúvesting friction‚Äù affects employee value perception and retention
	‚Ä¢	Important for talent acquisition (e.g., competitive hiring in tech)

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	Could add segmentation by job role, level, or geo to reveal where design may be misaligned

2.3. Time-Based Wealth Accrual

What:
	‚Ä¢	Median equity value vesting over time for new hires
	‚Ä¢	Chart shows value + % vested

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Communicates how long employees must stay to realize meaningful value
	‚Ä¢	Key retention lens

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	Consider modeling ‚Äúvalue drop-off‚Äù post-Year 4 for companies with back-loaded vesting

‚∏ª

3. Retention Risk Analytics

3.1. Attrition Spike at End of Vesting

What:
	‚Ä¢	Shows increase in attrition once original grant fully vests (esp. at 4-year mark)

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Exposes risk of front-loaded equity programs
	‚Ä¢	Justifies need for better refresh strategy or extended vesting designs

3.2. Wealth by Tenure

What:
	‚Ä¢	Median equity wealth by years at company
	‚Ä¢	Benchmarked to peers

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Demonstrates retention ROI of equity
	‚Ä¢	Helps justify plan costs to CFOs/boards

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	No view on total comp (salary + bonus + equity) or comparison to market comp

‚∏ª

4. Participant Behavior & Sentiment

4.1. Holding Behavior

What:
	‚Ä¢	% of RSUs held post-vesting by year
	‚Ä¢	Shows long-term holders vs. immediate sellers

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Useful proxy for confidence in company stock or financial need
	‚Ä¢	May indicate gaps in financial education or comp structure

4.2. Selling Behavior Analysis

What:
	‚Ä¢	RSU sales analyzed by age and tenure
	‚Ä¢	Impact of stock price or market volatility on selling
	‚Ä¢	Segment by education/satisfaction exposure

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Correlates behaviors with participant mindset
	‚Ä¢	Drives education/intervention strategy

4.3. Reason for Selling

What:
	‚Ä¢	Survey responses on why employees sell (e.g., bills, taxes, savings, investments)

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Reveals financial wellness pain points
	‚Ä¢	Could justify expanding benefits or education efforts

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	Could add a behavior model by function (e.g., do engineers sell more than finance?)

‚∏ª

5. Predictive Behavior Modeling

What:
	‚Ä¢	Build cohorts: who sells vs. who holds?
	‚Ä¢	Consider satisfaction, tenure, education exposure, trading frequency, etc.

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Enables proactive nudges (e.g., target likely sellers with education or regrants)

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	No stated A/B testing strategy to validate nudges or actions

‚∏ª

6. Equity & Retention Design Analysis

6.1. Equity Design vs. Retention

What:
	‚Ä¢	Examines whether offering multiple equity types (RSU + ESPP) leads to higher retention

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Justifies expansion of plan design (especially ESPP)
	‚Ä¢	Helps leaders balance cost vs. retention benefit

6.2. Cumulative Attrition Over Time

What:
	‚Ä¢	Attrition curve by tenure, benchmarked to peers
	‚Ä¢	Shows percent of employees who leave over time

So What:
	‚Ä¢	A retention ‚Äúhealth check‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Signals whether equity is doing its job

6.3. Retention Cohort Analysis

What:
	‚Ä¢	Arbitrary segmentation of tenure bands
	‚Ä¢	View of who stays and for how long

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Helps refine comp design by lifecycle stage

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	Could model impact of refresh grants on cohort retention

‚∏ª

7. ESPP Insights

7.1. Current Participation Snapshot

What:
	‚Ä¢	Participation rate and contribution amounts
	‚Ä¢	By tenure, age, geography

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Identifies under-engaged cohorts
	‚Ä¢	Opportunity for targeted campaigns

7.2. Benchmarking Participation vs. Peers

What:
	‚Ä¢	Sector/peer/market cap comparisons

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Allows execs to justify improvements or redesign

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	No correlation shown yet between ESPP design levers (lookback, discount, etc.) and participation

7.3. Sell vs. Hold Behavior Post-Purchase

What:
	‚Ä¢	Median holding period after ESPP purchase
	‚Ä¢	Peer benchmarks included

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Indicates whether ESPP is being used for wealth-building vs. short-term cash

7.4. Cohort Modeling for Participation

What:
	‚Ä¢	Who participates vs. who doesn‚Äôt?
	‚Ä¢	Segment by tenure, age, income, etc.

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Improves targeting of education/awareness efforts

‚∏ª

8. Executive Compensation (Optional Section)

What:
	‚Ä¢	PSU focus, TSR-based metrics
	‚Ä¢	Long share ownership tracking

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Vital for governance, board oversight, and proxy disclosure
	‚Ä¢	DoorDash example: tracking exec long holdings quarterly

Gap:
	‚Ä¢	No benchmarking of exec equity vs. peers (value, structure, mix)

‚∏ª

9. Storytelling Framework / Delivery Format

What:
	‚Ä¢	One-off PowerPoint reports
	‚Ä¢	Eventually dynamic dashboards with filters

So What:
	‚Ä¢	Makes the product more scalable and self-service
	‚Ä¢	Adds storytelling clarity for C-level audiences

Enhancement Opportunity:
	‚Ä¢	Add a callout on each slide: ‚ÄúWhat this tells us‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Mirror JP Morgan ‚ÄúGuide to the Markets‚Äù format with summary insights

‚∏ª

üîç Additional Gaps & Enhancement Opportunities

Gap / Enhancement	Why It Matters
‚úÖ No Total Comp View	Including salary + bonus + equity gives fuller retention picture
‚úÖ No Refresh Grant Analysis	Shows how ongoing equity supports long-term engagement
‚úÖ No Grant Size Benchmarking by Level	Reveals fairness and competitiveness of equity awards
‚úÖ No Gender/DEI Segmentation Yet	Helps reveal equity gaps or perception issues
‚úÖ No Scenario Modeling	‚ÄúWhat if‚Äù modeling (e.g., 5-year retention impact of changing vesting) would be powerful
‚úÖ No Benefit Integration	Cross-analyze equity behavior with other benefits (401k, HSA, etc.) to find synergy or cannibalization

Let me know if you want this turned into:
	‚Ä¢	A clean PPT storyboard
	‚Ä¢	A Google Doc briefing for stakeholders
	‚Ä¢	Or integrated into your live deck with speaker notes

I can also mock up a few ‚ÄúWhat this chart means‚Äù slide callouts if helpful.
